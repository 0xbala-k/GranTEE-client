## üéØ Problem Statement

Traditional scholarship systems suffer from several critical issues:

- **Unclaimed Scholarships**: Billions in funding goes unused annually due to lack of awareness, complex applications, and opaque processes
- **Biased Decision-Making**: Subjective evaluation processes create unintentional biases and unfair advantages
- **Unfair Fund Distribution**: Limited visibility and centralized power leads to inequitable allocation of resources
- **Monopolistic Control**: Large institutions dominate scholarship ecosystems, creating blindspots that leave deserving applicants overlooked
- **Privacy Concerns**: Students' sensitive information is often exposed during scholarship evaluation processes

## üí° Our Solution

GranTEE directly addresses these challenges through a novel combination of blockchain technology and Trusted Execution Environments:

### Democratizing Scholarship Access
- **Decentralized Discovery**: Open marketplace for scholarship creation and discovery, eliminating information asymmetry
- **Simplified Application Process**: User-friendly interface with standardized application flows reduces barriers to entry
- **Transparent Status Tracking**: Real-time status updates and transparent decision criteria

### Eliminating Bias
- **TEE-Protected Evaluations**: Applications evaluated in secure, private environments
- **Programmable Criteria**: Objective, code-based evaluation criteria eliminate human biases
- **Multi-Agent Consensus**: Multiple independent AI evaluators reach consensus decisions, preventing single points of bias

### Fair Fund Distribution
- **Smart Contract Enforcement**: Automated fund disbursement based on predefined, transparent criteria
- **Immutable Records**: Blockchain-based history of all transactions creates accountability
- **Decentralized Governance**: Community oversight prevents monopolistic control

### Privacy Protection
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Students can prove eligibility without revealing sensitive information
- **Secure Enclave Processing**: Application data processed within TEEs, inaccessible to outside parties
- **Encrypted Communication**: End-to-end encryption for all communications
